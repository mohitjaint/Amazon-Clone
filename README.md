# Amazon Clone

This is a simple Amazon-like web application that I built while learning JavaScript. The project was part of the **"JavaScript Tutorial Full Course"** by [SuperSimpleDev](https://supersimple.dev/).

## Project Overview

The course provided all the HTML and CSS files for this clone, and I was tasked with making the website interactive using JavaScript. Each lesson introduced new concepts like DOM manipulation, `querySelector`, `fetch`, and more.  

This project served as a hands-on learning experience that helped sharpen my development skills and provided a practical understanding of JavaScript concepts.
